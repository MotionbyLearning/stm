# Installation

STMTools can be installed from PyPI:

```sh
pip install stmtools
```

or from the source:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:TUDelftGeodesy/stmtools.git
cd stmtools
pip install .
```

Note that Python version `>=3.10` is required for STMTools.

## Tips

We strongly recommend installing separately from your default Python environment. E.g. you can use environment manager e.g. [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html) to create separate environment.
