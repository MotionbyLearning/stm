# STMTools

 (Space-Time Matrix Tools) is an Xarray extension for Space-Time Matrix (*Bruna et al., 2021; van Leijen et al., 2021*). It provides tools to read, write, enrich and manipulate a Space-Time Matrix (STM).

A STM is a data array containing data with a space (point, location) and time (epoch) component, as well as contextual data. STMTools utilizes Xarrayâ€™s multi-dimensional labeling feature, and Zarr's chunk storage feature, to efficiently read and write large Space-Time matrices.

The contextual data enrichment functionality is implemented with Dask. Therefore it can be performed in a paralleled style on Hyper-Performance Computation (HPC) systems.
